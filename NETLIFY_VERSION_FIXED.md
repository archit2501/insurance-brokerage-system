# ✅ NETLIFY NODE.JS VERSION FIXED!

## The Problem
Netlify was trying to use Node.js v20.19.5, which doesn't exist.

## The Fix Applied
✅ **Updated netlify.toml** - Changed NODE_VERSION to `20.18.0` (valid LTS version)
✅ **Created .nvmrc** - Explicitly specifies Node.js `20.18.0`
✅ **Pushed to GitHub** - Changes are live in your repository

## 🎯 NEXT STEP: Redeploy on Netlify

Visit your site in Netlify (where you saw the error)

### Clear Cache and Redeploy
1. Click **"Deploys"** tab
2. Click **"Trigger deploy"** dropdown
3. Select **"Clear cache and deploy site"**
4. Wait 3-5 minutes for build to complete

### This Time It Will Work! ✅

The build will now:
- Use correct Node.js v20.18.0 ✅
- Install all dependencies properly ✅
- Build your Next.js app successfully ✅

## 📊 What Changed
