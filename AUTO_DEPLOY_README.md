# ðŸ¤– FULLY AUTOMATED DEPLOYMENT

**Zero manual work - just provide credentials once!**

---

## ðŸš€ Run This ONE Command:

```powershell
.\auto-deploy.ps1
```

---

## What It Does Automatically:

âœ… Checks prerequisites (Node, npm, Git)
âœ… Generates all secrets
âœ… Creates .env file
âœ… Commits to Git
âœ… Installs Vercel CLI (if needed)
âœ… Deploys to Vercel
âœ… Configures all environment variables
âœ… Gives you the live URL

**Total time: ~3 minutes**

---

## What You Need to Provide:

When the script asks, you'll need:

1. **TURSO_CONNECTION_URL** (from https://turso.tech/app)
   - Looks like: `libsql://your-db.turso.io`

2. **TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN** (from https://turso.tech/app)
   - Your database auth token

**That's it!** The script handles everything else automatically.

---

## Don't Have Turso Credentials Yet?

### 2-minute setup:

1. Go to: **https://turso.tech/app**
2. Sign up (free)
3. Create a database
4. Copy the connection URL
5. Create/copy an auth token

Then run: `.\auto-deploy.ps1`

---

## After Running the Script:

You'll get:
- âœ… Live Vercel URL
- âœ… All environment variables configured
- âœ… App ready to test
- âœ… Instructions to share with client

**Everything automated!** ðŸŽ‰

---

## Troubleshooting:

### "Vercel login required"
- The script will open a browser for you to login
- Login with GitHub
- Return to terminal and continue

### "Missing Turso credentials"
- Make sure you copied them from https://turso.tech/app
- URL must start with `libsql://`
