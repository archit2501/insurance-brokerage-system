## What's NOT Implemented (Optional)

### Co-Insurance UI Component
Currently, co-insurance data must be added via API/database:
```sql
INSERT INTO cnInsurerShares (noteId, insurerId, percentage, amount) VALUES
(123, 1, 45.00, 450000.00),
(123, 2, 35.00, 350000.00),
(123, 3, 20.00, 200000.00);
```

A UI component for this would allow:
- Add/remove insurers dynamically
- Real-time percentage validation
- Auto-calculate amounts
- Visual feedback (must sum to 100%)

**Complexity**: Medium (2-3 hours)
