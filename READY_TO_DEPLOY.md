## 🚀 Deploy Now - Choose Your Method

### Method 1: Vercel Dashboard (RECOMMENDED - Easiest)

**Time: 10 minutes**

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```powershell
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
   
   # Create repo at https://github.com/new
   # Then:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Vercel**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Add these environment variables:
     ```
     TURSO_CONNECTION_URL = (your database URL)
     TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN = (your database token)
     BETTER_AUTH_SECRET = (generate: openssl rand -base64 32)
     BETTER_AUTH_URL = https://your-app.vercel.app
     ```
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait 2-3 minutes
   - **IMPORTANT**: After first deploy, update `BETTER_AUTH_URL` with your actual URL and redeploy

3. **Share with Client**
   ```
   URL: https://your-app.vercel.app
   Email: testuser@insurancebrokerage.com
   Password: Test@123456
   ```

### Method 2: Vercel CLI (Faster for Updates)

```powershell
# Install
npm install -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel

# Production deploy
vercel --prod
```

### Method 3: Use Deployment Script

```powershell
.\deploy.ps1
```

## 🔑 Required Environment Variables

Get these ready before deploying:

### 1. TURSO_CONNECTION_URL
```
Format: libsql://your-database-name.turso.io
Where: Turso Dashboard → Your Database → Connection URL
```

### 2. TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN
```
Where: Turso Dashboard → Your Database → Create Token
Copy: The full token (starts with eyJ...)
